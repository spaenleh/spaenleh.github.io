			<strong> Github Actions automation:</strong> I have experience using github actions to perform
			automated testing, builds and deployments
		</p>

			<strong>AWS infrastructure:</strong> Working with a full-fledged app hosted on AWS infra, I have
			experience navigating logs, container and services configurations, S3 storage, cloudfront CDN,
			databases, load balancers and hosted zones (DNS).
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Clean Code:</strong> I value clean code and have been doing code reviews for various projects.
			I enjoy contributing to Open Source projects when I can. Without getting too dogmatical I like
			to write idiomatic code that can be easily understood. I know when to do one-liners and when to
			write boring code that can be more easily changed and maintained in the future.
